my favorite character is spong pop.
 He is yellow. His eyes are blue and he wears a white shirt, a red tie, brown pants and black shoes. He works at the “Crust Crab” His manager is a lobster.

      
<br><br>  His house is a pineapple. He has a pet named Gary. Sponge Bob’s friends are Sandy the squirrel, Patrick the starfish and Squidward the octopus. Sandy does not like living in the ocean because she’s a squirrel. She lives in a garden near the sea.
        
<br><br>Sponge Bob and Patrick are always together. Once they went to the Carnival Festival because it was Patrick’s birthday. Patrick wasn’t having fun because Sponge Bob was playing alone and he was very disappointed. Then Patrick left home and Sponge Bob didn’t find him.
        
      <br><br>I like Sponge Bob very much because he is very funny and cute.
